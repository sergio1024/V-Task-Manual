#V-Task-Manual

#What does this code do:

This program will create a copy of the folder you specify,
Copy all the files from the source folder to the replica folder, and it will do this periodically,
in an interval of time of your choice, defined in minutes.

If the destination folder does not exist, it will be created.
If the log file does not exist, a new log file will be created.
